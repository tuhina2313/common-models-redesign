Add pure abstract method `validate` to Stage
 - Reasoning: Force future devs to consciously choose whether/how to validate their stages
 - Consider ways to enforce `validate` method call somewhere in the `execute` for all subclasses
 	- example where this would be helpful: EvaluationStage

Refactoring
 - Rename all stages to end with `Stage` suffix
 - Correct naming insonsistencies to the following:
 	- Class Names --> PascalCase
 	- Functions   --> camelCase
 	- Variables   --> under_scores

Update ModelTrainingStage
 - should accept a training_context object

 Update feature column names after encoding stage

 Update CrossValidationStage
  - should accept training context

Finish GenerateCVFoldsStage functionality


Initialize prediction vector wrt to classification (int)/regression (float) arg provided by user (in cross_validation.py)


Add in functionality to preprocessing.py stages to fit transformers on train data (_fit_transform_data_idx) and then transform full data set of cols
    NOTE - this has been implemented (not tested) in the ImputeMissingValsPreprocessingStage class

Complete TODOs in cross_validation.py execute method
    We need a way of specifying what the train/test folds are and then add that information to the pipeline without using the context
